# Scratch area

- Notes that need sorting out at some point

## Indentity

- Endomorphism: domain and co-domain is the same
- Category of endomorphisms.  All objects have identity link, but no other arrows, all are isolated.
- Homset - list of all arrows between X and Y.  Enhanced Cat

## Isomorphic

- Cancel to id

## Cardinality

[Crazy blog](http://chris-taylor.github.io/blog/2013/02/10/the-algebra-of-algebraic-data-types/)
- Sum is +
- Product is *
- -> is power.  e.g.  type of 3 values -> bool = 2^3.  A -> B has B^A values
- so `|A -> B| = |B| ^ |A|`, where `|X|` is the cardinality of X  (hence why function types are sometimes called exponential types)

## Functor

- Another name for category morphism

##Â Initial

- Unit in Hask

## Terminal

- () in Hask

## Comutting diagram

- Every path to same point must be considered the same
