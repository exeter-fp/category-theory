# 3. Categories Great and Small

- Zero category, no objects and no morphisms
- _Free Category:_ Simple dag. For any two links, add another for the composition. Also add self links.
 - Free because no further restrictions
- Morphisms are relations between objects:
 - Preorder: e.g. a <= b, b <= c.  Only 1 relation, so category is _thin_. Cycles allowed.
 - Partial order: i.e. a <= b, b >= a then a = b. No cycles allowed.
 - Linear or total order: If all objects have a relationship
- C(a,b) or Homc(a,b) is category of C of relations between a and b, called a _hom-set_
