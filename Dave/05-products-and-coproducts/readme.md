# Products and Coproducts

- Follow shape of arrows, link graph theory patterns
- Rank objects into hierarchy

## Initial

- Initial object has zero or one and only one morphism to others
- e.g. Empty set, absurd, lowest in poset 
- Maybe be none or more than 1 but unique up to isomorphism

## Terminal

- Terminal object is the dual of initial
- is unit. One and only one function to it, singleton in sets (vs Bool which has two funds)
- Duality: reverse, with Terminal and Initial reversed in co-category
- Isomorphic: two morphisms in opposite directions. Both cancel to id 
- Product, can get stuff back in most efficient way. Factorises other ones if it can get from them, but not back.  Product of two sets
- Coproduct is the opposite, injected

? is bottom the terminal in Hask ?
