> This is not a sophisticated text. In writing it, I have assumed no more mathematical knowledge than might be acquired from an undergraduate degree at an ordinary British university, and I have not assumed that you are used to learning mathematics by reading a book rather than attending lectures. Furthermore, the list of topics covered is deliberately short, omitting all but the most fundamental parts of category theory. 

Hmm - sounds promising, but after a brief glance, I thought it looked quite advanced for my brain - Nick.
